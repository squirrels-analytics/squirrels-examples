# weather_analytics

Example Squirrels project for weather analytics and ice cream sales

## Setup

1. Create an account on MotherDuck for free: https://motherduck.com/
2. Run the following in a notebook:
    - ATTACH 'md:_share/squirrels_analytics_public_db/597bd9c2-72c8-49b9-8ed6-f3d4441fda24'
3. Go to Settings > General and create an access token (will be used in step 5)
4. In this project, copy the "assets/env_example.yml" file as "env.yml" in the root of the project (note that this filename is git ignored)
5. Save the access token in "env.yml" in the "credentials > motherduck_token > password" field

Going forward (or until your access token expires), you will be able to use the APIs for the "ice_cream_sales_trend" dataset!
